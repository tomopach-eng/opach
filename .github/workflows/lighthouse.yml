# Lighthouse CI workflow is currently disabled due to SSL certificate issues
# with the opach.online domain. To re-enable:
# 1. Fix the SSL certificate for opach.online (or 1.opach.online based on CNAME)
# 2. Verify the site is accessible via HTTPS
# 3. Uncomment the 'on:' triggers below
# 4. Or update the URL to a working domain with valid SSL
